# Rullo Solver

## About the Project

This is a solver for the Rullo puzzle app ([iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.akkad.rullo&hl=en_US)/[Android](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rullo/id1200714079?mt=8)). The game is a little like Sudoku and can be solved by an exhaustive search in most cases. This program served as a proof that some higher levels in the game have multiple solutions. This implementation does not include a backtracking component to find all possible solutions by branching when arbitrary choices are required.

## Python

```bash
python main.py ../levels/6x6_1.txt
```

## Haskell

This code is still in development
